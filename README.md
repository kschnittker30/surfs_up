# Project Overview:
Perform analysis to compare temperature data for months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. A summary statistics for June and December weather temperatures will be created.

## Resources:
-Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
-Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook

## Results:
Comparing the Summary statistics for June and December weather temperatures, the June mean is 74.9 and December mean 71.04.  This is only a 4 degree difference. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles between June and December are also 3-4 degree differences. The temperature in December is slightly cooler than June, however well within a reasonable range to predict a stable temperature for surf and ice cream sales.  The difference between the 25th and 75th percentile for June is 4 degrees and for December is 5 degrees. The majority of the weather tempeartures are within 4-5 degrees of themselves, allowing for more consistent weather temperatures.

## Summary:
The weather tempeartures for June and December are very comparable with December being slightly cooling. This will allow for sustainable year-round sales of surf and ice ceam sales. It is recommended to perform further analysis on an hourly basis to determine the ideal time for sales based on the temperature. It is also recommended to look at the percipation for June and December to determine if June and December are comparable. If there is higher percipitation in December, there will be lowered sales compared to June.
